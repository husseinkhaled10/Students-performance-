The dataset consists of 20,000 rows and 13 columns, representing student academic and behavioral data.
It is designed to analyze the key factors that influence student performance, including demographics, attendance, sleep habits, study methods, and learning environment quality.

Original Columns

The dataset includes the following core attributes:

Student_ID – Unique identifier for each student

Age – Student age

Gender – Student gender

Course – Academic course or subject

Sleep_Hours – Average number of hours slept per day

Class_Attendance – Student class attendance percentage

Sleep_Quality – Self-reported quality of sleep

Study_Method – Primary study method used by the student

Facility_Rate – Rating of educational facilities

Exam_Difficulty – Difficulty level of the exam

Exam_Score – Final exam score

Created coulmns (Added for Analysis)

To enhance analytical depth and support better behavioral insights, additional derived columns were created:

# Age Group

Student ages were categorized into four age groups to better understand performance patterns and behavioral differences across different age ranges.

# Attendance Rate

Class attendance was grouped into three performance-based categories:

Low Attendance: Less than 50%

Medium Attendance: Between 50% and 75%

High Attendance: Above 75%

This categorization helps evaluate the relationship between attendance consistency and exam performance.

# Sleep Time Category

Sleep duration was classified to better assess the impact of sleep habits on academic outcomes:

bad Sleep: Less than 6 hours

Great Sleep: Between 6 and 8 hours

Over Sleep: More than 8 hours

Purpose of created coulmns

These features enable:

Clearer behavioral segmentation of students

Improved comparison across age, attendance, and sleep patterns

More meaningful insights into the drivers of academic success
